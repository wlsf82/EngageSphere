# Test cases

Below is a list of test cases that could be covered by automated scripts for the **EngageSphere** application.

The tests should cover both the API and Graphical User Interface (GUI.)

## API

When sending a GET request to the `/customers` endpoint:

- Successfully retrieves customers (e.g., checks for the 200 status code)
- Paginates the customer list correctly
- Filters customers by size correctly
- Returns the correct structure of the response (i.e., `customers` and `pageInfo` properties)
- Handles invalid requests gracefully (e.g., negative page )
- Handles invalid requests gracefully (e.g., negative limit)
- Handles invalid requests gracefully (e.g., page as a string)
- Handles invalid requests gracefully (e.g., limit as a boolean)
- Handles invalid requests gracefully (e.g., unsupported size)
